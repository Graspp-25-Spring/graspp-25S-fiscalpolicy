## 🎯 "How Does The Dependency Ratio Influence Fiscal Policy Spending?"

This question tries to examine how governments adjust and allocate spending (e.g., more to health vs education vs infrastructure) depending on the age composition of their population.

---

## ⚖️ Why is it important?

1. A changing demographic problem.  
   For example, in an aging society: a higher share of elderly → more healthcare and pensions → less room for education/infrastructure?

2. Fiscal sustainability.  
   More dependents = fewer taxpayers → pressure on public budgets

3. Efficiency dilemma.  
   Should resources go to the old or to future generations?

## 💡 Hypothesis

A higher dependency ratio leads to a shift in fiscal policy toward social sectors (health, pensions, education), and away from capital expenditure (e.g., infrastructure).
