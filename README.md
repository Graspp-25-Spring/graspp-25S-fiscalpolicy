## üß† Demographic Structure and Health-Education Spending Analysis

This project explores how changes in a country‚Äôs demographic profile‚Äîsuch as population aging, youth dependency, and working-age ratio‚Äîaffect the allocation and efficiency of public spending in the health and education sectors.

---

## üéØ Research Objectives

1. Examine how demographic structures shape fiscal priorities in health and education spending.
2. Project long-term public expenditure in health and education based on demographic and economic indicators.
3. Construct a cross-country **Health-Education Efficiency Index (HEE)** that benchmarks spending effectiveness.

## üìä Data and Variables

The dataset covers 54 countries from 2000 to 2022, selected based on World Values Survey (WVS) availability and data completeness. Projection models extend up to 2050.

## üß© Research Framework

This project is organized into three main components:

### üéØ 1. Demographic Structure and Public Spending

We analyze the relationship between demographic composition and government expenditure in health and education. This includes visualizations of population pyramids of dependency ratios and scatter plots between spending and demographic indicators

To empirically test this relationship, we estimate the following panel regression:

$$
\text{Spending}_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{DependencyRatio\_Old}_{it} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{DependencyRatio\_Young}_{it} + \beta_3 \cdot \ln(\text{GDPpc}_{it}) + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- \( i \) indexes countries  
- \( t \) indexes years

---

### üéØ 2. Health and Education Expenditure Projections (to 2050)

Using the relationships established in Part 1, we forecast future expenditure levels. The process includes:

- **Log-linear GDP projection**:

$$
\log(\text{GDP}_{t}) = \alpha + \delta \cdot t + \varepsilon_t
$$

- **Demographic forecasting** using existing UN projections on dependency ratios
- **Spending forecast** based on coefficients from regression models:

$$
\widehat{\text{Spending}}_{t} = f(\text{Projected Dependency Ratio}_t, \text{Projected GDP per capita}_t)
$$

---

### üéØ 3. Health-Education Efficiency Index (HEE)

We assess how effectively countries convert fiscal inputs into social outcomes by constructing the HEE Index, based on [ECB (2020)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp242.pdf):

#### Step 1: Health-Education Performance (HEP)
- Combine four outcome indicators:
  - *Health*: Life expectancy, infant mortality rate
  - *Education*: Average years of schooling, learning outcomes
- Normalize each indicator
- Assign equal weights and average to compute HEP
- Set average HEP across countries to 1

#### Step 2: Efficiency Calculation
- Normalize health and education spending
- Calculate:

$$
\text{HEE}_i = \frac{\text{HEP}_i}{\text{Normalized Spending}_i}
$$
