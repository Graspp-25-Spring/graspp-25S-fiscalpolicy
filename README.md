## Demographic Structure and Health-Education Spending Analysis
This project explores how changes in a countryâ€™s demographic profileâ€”such as population aging, youth dependency, and working-age ratioâ€”affect the allocation and efficiency of public spending in the health and education sectors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives:

1. Analyze how demographic structure influences fiscal policy priorities, specifically health and education expenditure.
2. Project future health and education spending using key variables such as age distribution, dependency ratios, GDP per capita, and population growth.
3. Construct a Health-Education Efficiency Index, comparing outcomes (e.g., life expectancy, infant mortality, school enrollment) relative to public spending levels across countries.

## ðŸ“Š Data and Variables

The dataset compiles data from 54 countries selected based on the World Values Survey (WVS) and the availability of the data to reflect diverse global conditions. It spans the period from 2000 to 2022. Projection data will be projected up until 2050.
