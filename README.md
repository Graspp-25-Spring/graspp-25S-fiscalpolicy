## ðŸŽ¯ "How Does Demographic Structure Influence Fiscal Policy Spending?"

This question explores how governments adjust and allocate public spendingâ€”e.g., toward health, education, or developmentâ€”depending on the age composition of their population.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis

A higher dependency ratio leads to a shift in fiscal policy toward social sectors (health, pensions, education), and away from capital expenditure (e.g., research and development).

## ðŸ“Š Data and Variables

- The dataset compiles data from 64 countries selected based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to reflect diverse global conditions. It spans the period from 2000 to 2020. The main focus is to examine the influence of demographic structure â€” using the age dependency ratioâ€”on government spending in health, education, research & development (R&D), and social contributions.
